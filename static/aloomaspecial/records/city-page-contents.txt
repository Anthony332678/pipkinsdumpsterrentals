Mistakes to Avoid When Renting a Dumpster in #State<h2>
While renting a dumpster might seem straightforward, there are common mistakes people often make. Avoid these pitfalls to ensure you get the best value from your rental:<list>
Wrong Size: Renting a dumpster that’s too small can lead to overage fees and unnecessary hassle. Take the time to estimate your waste volume and choose the appropriate size.^^
Ignoring Restrictions: Each dumpster has a list of restricted items (e.g., hazardous materials, electronics, tires). Make sure you’re familiar with these to avoid penalties.^^
Late Pickups: Ensure you plan your dumpster rental with enough time for the project. Returning the dumpster late may result in extra charges.^^
Blocking Access: If your dumpster is placed in a spot that obstructs traffic or access, you may need to move it, which could delay your project.
